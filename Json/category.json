          "m_descrip": " Solomon Islands Light: Pothos prefers bright but indirect light although they can also adapt to partial shade. Variegated plants sometimes lose their leaf pattern and revert to all-green plants if they don’t get enough light; moving them to brighter conditions usually restores the variegation. Suddenly paler-looking leaves mean the plant is getting too much sun. If you notice it is getting leggy, it may need more light. Water: Pothos like to have their soil dry out completely between waterings. If left continually in damp soil, the roots will rot. Black spots on the leaves and the sudden collapse of the plant indicate the soil has been kept too wet. Let the plant tell you when to water — when it starts to droop, it needs a good drink. However, don’t wait until the leaves start to shrivel or you will lose some leaves. Dry, brown edges mean the plant was kept dry too long. Soil: Pothos plants thrive in ordinary, well-draining potting soil. Temperature: Pothos should be kept at room temperature of 18 to 24°C. Fertilizer: Pothos aren’t heavy feeders, but since there are no nutrients in most potting soils, feed monthly to bi-monthly with any balanced houseplant fertilizer during growing season. Humidity: This plant likes high humidity but it is very tolerant and can thrive even where there is low humidity. For best results, mist once a week in the summer and once every two weeks in the winter. Pruning: Keep the stems trimmed relatively short to keep foliage full along the full stems. If stems grow bare, they can be cut back to the soil level, and new stems will sprout. Re-Potting: Eventually, your Pothos will become pot bound. When the leaves droop, no matter how much or often you water them, the roots have probably filled the pot. Carefully lift the plant and check to see if this is the problem. When the plant has reached this stage, you can re-pot in a container one or two sizes larger, filled with fresh potting soil. Propagation: This plant is easily propagated simply by taking stem cuttings and rooting them in water or in potting soil. Move cuttings rooted in water into the soil as soon as possible so they can begin getting nutrients. Diseases and Pests: Diseases and pest problems in Epipremnum are not common, although they do exist. One of the biggest culprits of both is overwatering so watering plants only when they need it will help prevent problems. Toxicity: These plants are poisonous. Keep them away from children and pets and take care when handling.",

Roots can be very brittle so make sure that you’re very gentle and don’t even try to separate or spread them out. Gently pack the soil around the roots with your fingers and make sure that you’re not over pressing the soil so that you won’t break the fragile roots.
